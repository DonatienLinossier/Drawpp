    Basically a list of problems, which can grow in size while processing code in the pipeline.

    This object is meant to be passed to each step of the pipeline, so we can aggregate all problems
    each step finds, even if there are errors during the process! For example, the tokenizer might find an error,
    but that doesn't prevent the parser from finding more of them.

    At the end of the pipeline, this will contain all problems found during the compilation process,
    which should all be displayed to the user on the IDE. The IDE will be able to use this class to do so.

    Contains lists of problem for each severity (``ProblemSeverity``) in the ``grouped`` attribute, which can be
    useful to get all warnings, all errors...

    Can be used as if it was a list of problems! You can use for/len/in etc. on it.
    For example, the following code works: ::

        ps = ProblemSet()
        add_tons_of_errors(ps)
        for problem in ps:
            print(problem)
